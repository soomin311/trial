        <!-- Book Cover Section -->
        <h2 class="section-title">Book Cover</h2>

        <div class="image-row">
            <img src="pre_bookcover.png" alt="Original Image" class="project-img">
            <img src="bookcover.png" alt="Book Cover" class="project-img">
        </div>

        <p class="project-text">
        I used the photo above as the original image for my book cover because it was one of the highest-resolution photos I had.
        Since the background was quite dark, I wrote the title and author names in white for better visibility. To make the author
        names stand out more clearly from the background, I added a semi-transparent rectangle behind them and applied a blur effect,
        creating a subtle separation. The original book title began with the word “Mapping,” but because my image shows a
        star-filled night sky, I replaced it with “Navigating” to better align with the visual theme.
        </p>

        <p class="project-text">
        In the original photo, the trees on both sides were visually distracting. To address this, I used the Clone tool to replicate
        the stars and extend the sky area, effectively removing the trees and creating a more open, spacious composition. I also used
        the Dodge tool to darken the bottom portion of the image so that viewers would focus more on the title rather than the lower
        details. Finally, I added the Springer logo at the bottom. Since the logo originally had a white background, I used the Invert
        function to adjust it, ensuring it matched the overall dark tone of the cover.
        </p>

        <!-- Personal Logo Section -->
        <h2 class="section-title" style="margin-top: 70px;">Personal Logo</h2>

        <div class="image-row">
            <img src="logo.png" alt="Personal Logo" class="project-img logo-img">
        </div>

        <p class="project-text">
        I wanted to take this opportunity to design my own logo, so I chatted with ChatGPT to reflect on what values matter most to me.
        Through our conversation, I identified three key themes: <strong>authenticity, connection, and growth</strong>. Thus, I tried to
        integrate these into my design. The circular form symbolizes continuity and balance, while the diamond at the center reflects
        integrity and self-awareness.
        </p>

        <p class="project-text">
        Because I wanted the logo to resemble a badge, I found a helpful tutorial on YouTube:
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX4T9sw6zIM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX4T9sw6zIM</a>.
        One of the key features I used was thick lines for a badge-like style. Texts were intentionally written in all caps with bold weight.
        </p>

        <p class="project-text">
        To create the design, I used several key tools in Inkscape (Ctrl + Shift + C for circles, Ctrl + B for lines, Path → Object to Path,
        Text → Put on Path). Then, I applied the Cut Path function to divide the shape into sections, keeping only the curved line
        connecting “CONNECT” and “GROWTH.” The final color scheme was achieved by layering two circles and adjusting their stacking order.
